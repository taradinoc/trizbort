-------------
This initial build is based off the last build from Genstein.  It also pulls in a few other forks that had some useful features.  

Features pulled from the Tymian branch
++ Allowed rooms to have their own colors, this overrides the global default room color.  [Room Properties Dialog]
++ Adds the ability to split a rooms color 50/50.  [Room Properties Dialog]
++ Ability to copy / paste of elements.

Bugs fixed in Tymian Branch
== Issue with large maps locking up or slow loading when opening.

This also pulls from the tustin2121 fork which adds a few small features.

++ App settings dialog
++ Added invert mouse wheel setting
++ added canvas drag mouse button setting.

Then this adds some of my own changes.

++ Added Smart Save feature which will save PDF and image file in one click to the project folder.
++ Added a default image type in app settings that Smart Save uses for saving the image.
++ Now you can add regions.  Regions can be setup in the map settings dialog, named and a color assigned to it.
++ In the room properties, you can now assign a room to a region.  This will show the room in the region color assigned to the region.
++ some minor bug fixes.
